In this work,  we propose a trainingfree
reduced-reference (RR) objective quality assessment
method that quantifies the perceived quality of synthesized
textures. The proposed reduced-reference synthesized texture
quality assessment metric is based on measuring the
spatial and statistical attributes of the texture image using
both image- and gradient-based wavelet coefficients at
multiple scales.
