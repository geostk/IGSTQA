Reference:
Synthesized Texture Quality Assessment via Multi-scale Spatial and Statistical Texture Attributes of Image and Gradient Magnitude Coefficients  CVPRW 2018.

Usage:
--------------------------------------------
Run the Demo to make sure the code works successfully with your system and then you can use IGSTQA to assess the quality of synthesized textures.
Please make sure to clear the paths in your matlab so you do not receive error.
